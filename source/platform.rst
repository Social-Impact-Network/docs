===================================
Social Impact Platform (Frontend)
===================================

SI Platform provides the user interface for SI Token and Transparent Impact Measurment System (TIM) components for easy and intutitive use. All dynamic information presented on SI platform is obtained from decentralized networks (Ethereum, BigChainDB). No centralized local database is used. Thus, the entire SI platform can be set up locally without an additional local database. 

SI platform contains the following functions for interaction with SI Smart Contract:

* MetaMask integration
* Investing in SIP (in ETH or DAI)
* Receiving tokens (SIP)
* Payment distribution to project beneficiaries
* Receiving interest and payouts by project beneficiaries (in DAI).
* Enforcement of interest calculation and payout processing (in DAI)

For representation of impact values, SI Platform accesses `SI Node of Social Impact Network <./transparent-impact-measurement.html#list-of-active-si-nodes>`_.


Set up SI platform locally
-------------------------------

To set up SI platform locally (e.g. to develop your own frontend), please read `Readme <https://github.com/Social-Impact-Network/Frontend>`_. on Github.
