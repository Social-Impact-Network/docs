=================================================
Welcome to Social Impact Network's documentation!
=================================================

Social Impact Network is the place where you can easily invest in in projects having social impact.

The magic behind Social Impact Network: Your investment is completely transparent, flexible and secure with blockchain technology applied to your investments.

* 	Transparency: You can track the impact of your investment such as clean energy produced and CO2 emissions reduced/eliminated.
* 	Flexibility: You can trade your investment at any time.
* 	Security: Your money is safe. All funds allocation and distribution are managed by Smart Contracts on a public blockchain.


This documentation will help you understand the Social Impact Network ecosystem.
You will learn how to extract impact values from the network, how to run your own Social Impact Node and how to develop software that interacts with the Social Impact Network (e.g. DeFI projects).


The entire Social Impact Network is an open source project, so feel free to suggest any new topics or content via `GitHub <https://github.com/Social-Impact-Network/docs/issues>`_.
